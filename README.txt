MINECRAFT: DIVE INTO THE ABYSS
---------------


This mod adds a new dimension revolving around the ancient city ambiance, adding unique lore and
gameplay mechanics. The new dimension **Abyss** is intended to be reached after the End to offer the player
a new challenge and a new experience. The Abyss is a dark and mysterious place, filled with ancient ruins
of a long-gone civilization. The player will have to explore the Abyss to find new resources, new mobs, and
new structures.

Where does the corruption come from ? What is the Radiance that seems to fight the darkness ?

Will you choose to fight the darkness or to become a part of it ?

Source installation information for modders
-------------------------------------------
This code follows the Minecraft Forge installation methodology. It will apply
some small patches to the vanilla MCP source code, giving you and it access 
to some of the data and functions you need to build a successful mod.

Note also that the patches are built against "un-renamed" MCP source code (aka
SRG Names) - this means that you will not be able to read them directly against
normal code.

Setup Process:
==============================

Step 1: Open your command-line and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file.

Step 2: You're left with a choice.
If you prefer to use Eclipse:
1. Run the following command: `./gradlew genEclipseRuns`
2. Open Eclipse, Import > Existing Gradle Project > Select Folder 
   or run `gradlew eclipse` to generate the project.

If you prefer to use IntelliJ:
1. Open IDEA, and import project.
2. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
3. Run the following command: `./gradlew genIntellijRuns`
4. Refresh the Gradle Project in IDEA if required.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can 
run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `gradlew clean` to reset everything 
(this does not affect your code) and then start the process again.

Mapping Names:
=============================
By default, the MDK is configured to use the official mapping names from Mojang for methods and fields 
in the Minecraft codebase. These names are covered by a specific license. All modders should be aware of this
license, if you do not agree with it you can change your mapping names to other crowdsourced names in your 
build.gradle. For the latest license text, refer to the mapping file itself, or the reference copy here:
https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MCPConfig/blob/master/Mojang.md
