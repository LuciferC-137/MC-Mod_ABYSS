MINECRAFT: DIVE INTO THE ABYSS
------------------------------


This mod adds a new dimension revolving around the ancient city ambiance, adding unique lore and
gameplay mechanics. The new dimension **Abyss** is intended to be reached after the End to offer the player
a new challenge and a new experience. The Abyss is a dark and mysterious place, filled with ancient ruins
of a long-gone civilization. The player will have to explore the Abyss to find new resources, new mobs, and
new structures.

Where does the corruption come from ? What is the Radiance that seems to fight the darkness ?

Will you choose to fight the darkness or to become a part of it ?
