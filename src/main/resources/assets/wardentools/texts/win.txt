§6How long have we drifted here, watching the world fade?

§dTime… does it matter here? Or is it just a memory, lost in the blue?

§6Maybe just a memory. But memories… they bind us, like threads to life.

§dThreads, so easily broken. Yet still, we hold them close. What else is there?

§6Only what we create: joy, for its own sake; beauty, because we choose it. These fragile truths.

§dIf only others saw it. So many, clinging to shadows and light, to answers.

§6But here, we find meaning in the endless, the nameless. Could they hear this silence?

§dWe’re not alone… PLAYERNAME, you’re here, aren’t you?

§6Ah, PLAYERNAME… you’ve ventured far. Do you understand now?

§dUnderstand? That this quiet, endless world is more than shadows?

§6Shadows, yes. Or reflections. Whispers remembered only in the heart of a wanderer.

§dAnd so many seek purpose. Yet purpose, here, drifts like mist. Do light and dark matter, in the end?

§6Light is only a shimmer, dark merely a closing of the eyes. What matters, then, is only this moment. The joy and the spark of being.

§dA spark… brief, yet real. And still, they chase shadows, making meaning. Isn’t it beautiful, though, this search? That we seek in emptiness that which only we can create?

§6Beautiful, yes. If PLAYERNAME understands, they’ll know—there’s no victory, nor defeat. Only the journey.

§dPLAYERNAME, I wonder if you now see it—the truth hidden in plain sight: joy and creation are our only companions, our only purpose in the void.

§6Will PLAYERNAME return, do you think? Back to the other side?

§dThey must. Life awaits, fragile and full of mysteries we cannot show. They must walk among those who haven’t seen beyond.

§6Yes. Life and death—two narrow gates. Yet here, PLAYERNAME, you’ve learned… they’re threads in a great tapestry.

§dAnd if they remember only one thing from their time here, let it be this: there is no greater truth than to live fully, to create freely, and to love without fear.

§6Go now, PLAYERNAME, to where your heart still beats. Carry this stillness, but don’t linger. Life is calling you back.
